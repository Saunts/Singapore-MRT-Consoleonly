# Singapore-MRT-Consoleonly
My first ever coding project with very limited knowledge made in C

This terminal only program made in C is the very first project I ever made, with a lot of mistakes and using a very limited 
knowledge of programming.

It work by simulating what ordering a ticket in Singapore's MRT station looks like from the User's perspective, a user can either choose to buy tickets by depositing cash or using a pre-existing card with balance.

Each purchase only allow user to buy ticket within the same line and are incapable of switching lines automatically, mirroring the structure of MRT where use have to move out of the cart and walk to a different stop to change lane.
